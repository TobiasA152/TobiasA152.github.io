  I just watched a movie with my family. Itâ€™s a Disney movie called Soul about jazz. To be honest, I wasnâ€™t expecting it to be good but I actually really liked it. Itâ€™s premise isnâ€™t really about jazz, itâ€™s about purpose. How people live, whatâ€™s a good life, when is death acceptable? It portrayed that most people live with no meaning, and the superficial goals they were looking for either werenâ€™t achieved or made no difference once they achieved it. I was thinking during the whole movie that before I would have felt the same, but now I have found true love, my life will be one I want to live. My life will be one without regret, that will be exciting, that will be filled with joy, meaning and stories. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When I say Iâ€™m so so happy, I mean I have the most peace, joy and satisfaction Iâ€™ve ever felt. But I also mean Iâ€™m content, Iâ€™m secure and I have got what I need. Thank you for coming into my life. Thank you for your devotion and your love. I really feel like every day with you is a day spent well, whether itâ€™s in real life or online (no matter what we do ;) ).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm excited to go through every day in our life
  <br/>

  In a field of grey nettles, weeds and spiky decaying vegetation, you are this amazing blossoming oak tree, beautiful and inspiring. You are infinitely times better than anyone or anything else and I really canâ€™t even compare. I wouldnâ€™t even bother looking at them as they are really just background noise now. You are incredible. You really are a unicorn. I love you.
